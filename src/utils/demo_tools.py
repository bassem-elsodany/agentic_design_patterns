demo_tools.py

This module provides example tools (functions) for use with agentic agents. 
It is designed for beginners to experiment with tool use, LLM integration, and agent reasoning in a safe, easy-to-understand way.

Key Concepts:
- Tool: A function that an agent can call to get information or perform a calculation.
- Decorator: The @tool decorator makes a function available to agents.
- Logging: Each tool logs its usage for transparency and debugging.

Example usage:
    from demo_tools import get_weather
    print(get_weather.run(city="Paris"))  # Output: Sunny, 22째C
